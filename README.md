# Coastal Threat Alert System
## Project Overview
The Coastal Threat Alert System is a comprehensive web-based platform designed to provide early warnings and real-time alerts for various coastal threats such as storm surges, coastal erosion, pollution, and cyclonic activity. It integrates data from sensors, weather forecasts, and historical patterns to help disaster management teams, coastal city governments, environmental NGOs, fisherfolk, and civil defense teams safeguard lives, property, and vital blue carbon habitats.

## Features
- **Dynamic Dashboard:** Displays active coastal threats categorized by severity (High, Medium, Low), weather status, population at risk, and region-specific threat details.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Shows current alerts with severity, recommended actions, expected impact, and affected population.
- **Coastal Regions Map:** Interactive visual map highlighting threat levels across different coastal regions.
- **Sensor Data & Weather Patterns:** Grid views presenting sensor readings (tide levels, wave heights, water quality) and detailed weather information.
- **User Interaction:** Tabbed navigation for seamless switching between Dashboard, Monitoring, Alerts, Analytics, and Settings.
- **Theme Toggle:** Supports light and dark themes.
- **Notification Management:** Ability to add, update, and manage alerts.
- **Responsive Design:** Clean and responsive UI optimized for various devices.
